# timelapse program
This is my solution for a imeplase program with web interface running on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. I am using this solution to create videos out of thounds of pictures recorded with the Raspberry Pi camera.

A detailed description of my solution is available on my blog: https://custom-build-robots.com/top-story-de/raspberry-pi-timelapse-fotografie-tutorial-bilder-im-zeitraffer-video/9970
